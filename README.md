Ghost-native MCP (Model Context Protocol) **client** for Ghost
Developer Studio. GhostIDE shells out to GhostMCP to talk to MCP
servers from a standard MCP config file, the `.mcp.json` shape
used across the ecosystem: listing servers, listing a server's
tools, calling a tool, reading resources, and fetching prompts,
in pure Python stdlib so it runs anywhere GhostIDE runs,
including on-device in the phone APK. A persistent `serve`
daemon mode keeps one session per server alive across calls
for interactive use.

MIT licensed. Dependencies: none. Protocol version
`2024-11-05`; client info `{"name": "ghostmcp", "version":
"0.3.2"}`. JSON-RPC 2.0 throughout.

## Usage

```
python -m ghostmcp servers --config <path>
python -m ghostmcp tools --config <path> --server <name> [--timeout N]
python -m ghostmcp call --config <path> --server <name> --tool <name> --args '<json object>' [--timeout N]
python -m ghostmcp resources --config <path> --server <name> [--timeout N]
python -m ghostmcp resource --config <path> --server <name> --uri <uri> [--timeout N]
python -m ghostmcp prompts --config <path> --server <name> [--timeout N]
python -m ghostmcp prompt --config <path> --server <name> --name <name> --args '<json object>' [--timeout N]
python -m ghostmcp serve --config <path>
```

Every one-shot verb prints ONE JSON object to stdout.
`--timeout` is in seconds, covers the whole invocation, and
defaults to 30. `serve` is the exception: it reads JSON-line
requests on stdin and answers one JSON line per request, for
as long as it runs.

### servers

Lists the config's servers **without connecting to anything**:

```json
{"config": "mcp.json", "servers": [
  {"name": "files", "transport": "stdio",
   "target": "python3 server.py --root /tmp",
   "env_names": ["API_KEY"]},
  {"name": "remote", "transport": "http",
   "target": "https://example.com/mcp", "env_names": []}]}
```

`target` is the command and args joined for a stdio server, or
the url for an HTTP server. `env_names` carries env **names
only** — see Security below.

### tools

Connects, handshakes, and lists the server's tools
(`tools/list`, following `nextCursor` pagination):

```json
{"server": "files", "tools": [
  {"name": "read_file", "description": "Read a file.",
   "inputSchema": {"type": "object",
                   "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}}}}]}
```

### call

Calls one tool and flattens its content: text blocks joined
with newlines, non-text blocks summarized as `[type: ...]`,
capped at 60,000 characters:

```json
{"server": "files", "tool": "read_file", "isError": false,
 "text": "the file's text"}
```

### resources, resource, prompts, prompt

The 0.2.0 verbs round out the read side of the protocol:
`resources` lists a server's resources (`resources/list`),
`resource` reads one by URI (`resources/read`), `prompts`
lists prompts (`prompts/list`), and `prompt` fetches one
rendered to messages (`prompts/get`). Binary resource contents
are reported by base64 size only, never dumped.

### serve

`serve` is the persistent session daemon added in 0.3.0. It
reads JSON-line requests on stdin (`{"id": 1, "verb": "tools",
"server": "files"}`), answers one JSON line per request, and
keeps one handshaken session per configured server alive
across requests, so interactive callers stop paying a fresh
server spawn for every list or call. The verbs mirror the CLI
(servers, tools, call, resources, resource, prompts, prompt)
plus `sessions` and `shutdown`. Sessions are dropped and
reopened when the config file changes on disk, a request that
fails on a dead session is retried once on a fresh one, and
idle sessions are reaped. GhostIDE routes its MCP traffic
through the daemon and falls back to the one-shot verbs if it
ever dies.

### Errors

Every failure prints `{"error": "..."}` to stdout and exits 2:
a missing or invalid config file, an unknown server name, bad
`--args` JSON, a server process that cannot start or dies
mid-session, a JSON-RPC error reply, an HTTP error status, and
timeouts.

One thing is deliberately **not** an error: a tool result the
server marked `isError: true`. That is the tool's own answer,
so it prints normally with `"isError": true` and exit 0.

## Config format

The standard MCP client config:

```json
{"mcpServers": {
  "files": {"command": "python3", "args": ["server.py"],
            "env": {"API_KEY": "..."}},
  "remote": {"url": "https://example.com/mcp"}}}
```

An entry with a `url` is an HTTP server; an entry with a
`command` is a stdio server. An entry with neither is an error.

## Transports

**Stdio.** The server is spawned as a child process per
invocation; JSON-RPC messages travel newline-delimited over its
stdin/stdout. The client sends `initialize`, then the
`notifications/initialized` notification, then the request. A
background reader matches replies by id; stray non-JSON lines
and server notifications are ignored, `ping` is answered, and
other server-initiated requests get a JSON-RPC method-not-found
reply. The child's stderr is drained and discarded so a chatty
server cannot deadlock on a full pipe. The child is **always**
terminated when the invocation ends — success, error, or
timeout.

**HTTP.** Each JSON-RPC message is a POST to the server `url`
(Streamable HTTP style). If a response carries an
`Mcp-Session-Id` header, the client sends it on every later
request in the same invocation. Bodies are accepted as plain
`application/json` or as `text/event-stream` (the reply is the
`data:` message whose id matches the request). A notification
such as `notifications/initialized` is posted and its (usually
empty, 202) reply ignored.

## Design: two session shapes

The one-shot verbs open a brand-new session per invocation, do
one listing or one call, and tear everything down. That makes
every invocation independent and crash-proof, since a hung or
hostile server can cost at most one timeout, and it is what
lets the same binary serve the desktop server and the phone.

The limit follows directly: **with the one-shot verbs, a
server that keeps state across calls inside its own process
will not keep it.** Anything held in the server's memory (an
in-memory cache, a half-finished multi-call workflow, a stdio
session's working set) resets on every call.

The `serve` daemon exists for exactly that limit. Callers that
need cross-call state or interactive speed hold sessions open
through the daemon; callers that need isolation use the
one-shot verbs. Servers that keep state in files, in a
database, or behind an HTTP session the server itself persists
are unaffected either way.

## Security

- Env **values** from the config are passed to stdio server
  processes (that is what they are for) but are never printed,
  returned, or logged anywhere by GhostMCP. The `servers` verb
  reports env names only, and error messages never quote config
  contents or a server's stderr.
- Tool `--args` are passed to the server and nowhere else; they
  are never logged.
- A config is a program launcher: a stdio entry runs its
  `command` with the invoking user's privileges. Only point
  GhostMCP at configs you trust, exactly as with any MCP host.

## Scope of 0.3.2, honestly

GhostMCP implements the client read-and-call surface:
`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `resources/list`,
`resources/read`, `prompts/list`, and `prompts/get`, over
stdio and HTTP, in one-shot CLI verbs and in the persistent
`serve` daemon. It does **not** implement OAuth or any auth
flow, sampling or elicitation (server-initiated requests
beyond `ping` are refused), or tool-list change
notifications. Those land only if a real GhostIDE need pulls
them in.
